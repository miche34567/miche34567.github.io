Hello reader! My name is Michelle Ametekpor and I am a Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies major and Public Health concentrator at Williams College. I'm a junior at Williams, and I do not have any sewing experience. I have a sewing machine collecting dust at home because I made a singular tube top for a fashion show in high school. I also am not a programmer. But I am a excellent crocheter and a terrible knitter.
