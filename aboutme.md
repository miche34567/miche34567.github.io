subtitle: Why electronic textiles
---

My name is Michelle. I am taking electronic textiles because I am interested in digital wear. I like looking cool so hopefully the class will teach me how to make cool clothes. I am into the aesthetics of clothes because I like wearing clothes that makes me feel confident. I also want to learn basics of code so I don't feel left out with the millions of CS majors I know.
